These should hold a few code samples to show off my abilities to you.

There are Three Samples containing 1-2 Files of Code.

The XNA Samples Display 2D Player Movement and Spritesheet Animation in XNA. You can see a sample of it here:

The WebGL Samples show off a piece of logic used to draw a complex point cloud that represents the temperature of a server.
It Also contains a pair of custom shaders used to achieve this effect.
I Do not currently have a preview available.

The Unity Samples show off basic, Ocarina-of-Time-esque player movement and camera behaviour. As those two are intimately connected.
As This Code is old and not up-to-date with Unity, however, I do not have a sample at this moment.
